@def title = "Hackathon"

The hackathon aims to support Julia users with their own projects or contributions to the Julia ecosystem.

# More info

* Have you always wanted to contribute to the Julia ecosystem, but werenâ€™t sure how?
* Do you have that one pull request that you could really use some help with?
* Did you just start using Julia, and want advice on your projects from others?
* Are you a long-time contributor with a never ending to-do list?
* Do you want to meet other Julia users, package developers, and maintainers?

During the hackathon, experienced Julia users will be around to answer questions and provide guidance, including walking through the process of making your first code contribution, so beginners are very much welcome!

We also have a couple of volunteer mentors who have offered to lead specific projects.
