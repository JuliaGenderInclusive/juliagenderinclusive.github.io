@def title = "Learn Julia With Us"

Looking to get started with Julia but don't know where to begin? Learn Julia with us, from the ground up. Together, we'll go through some of the best materials for learning Julia, starting from the basics. Those with no coding experience, users of other programming languages, and those from non-traditional backgrounds are all very welcome to join!

# Join
Find us on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/julia-gender-inclusive/).

# More info
Your instructors are two PhD students in linguistics with a background in R and Python. Julia & Kyla also organize R-Ladies Freiburg and teach statistics, so they are especially excited to welcome those who use R for data science, those who come from non-STEM backgrounds, and anyone who wants a judgement-free, encouraging approach to learning programming. The workshop will take place via Zoom.
