@def title = "About Us"

With a combination of community building, targeted
outreach, education, mentorship, and mutual support, we are addressing
[potential causes of gender under-representation](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/women-in-cs/main.html) in the Julia community. 

We welcome anyone who sees their gender as under-represented within this
community, including women, non-binary people, trans people of all genders, and
people exploring or questioning their gender. Because gender is multifaceted,
we are intentionally [being general about what gender under-representation
means](https://medium.com/@quinncrossley/uplifting-diverse-genders-beyond-women-and-non-binary-916c890f2185).
