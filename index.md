@def title = "Julia Gender Inclusive"

We are an initiative to promote gender diversity
and inclusion within the wider Julia community. 

We welcome anyone who sees their gender as under-represented within this
community, including women, non-binary people, trans people of all genders, and
people exploring or questioning their gender. Because gender is multifaceted,
we are intentionally [being general about what gender under-representation
means](https://medium.com/@quinncrossley/uplifting-diverse-genders-beyond-women-and-non-binary-916c890f2185).
